# CRUD Application

Details TBA - Identify a real-world business problem, design a proposed information system solution, then implement a portion of the systemâ€™s overall functionality. Implemented features should ideally include the ability to access the application over the Internet in order to create, read, update, and destroy (CRUD) database records.

Students are encouraged to implement this project using Node.js, but may optionally use any other server-side programming language (e.g. Ruby, Python, PHP).
