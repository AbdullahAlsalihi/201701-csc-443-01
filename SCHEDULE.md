## Schedule

This document contains a tentative week-by-week description of the topics and technologies covered during each class.

This schedule of in-class exercises is designed to prepare students for success in their project development endeavors. It also helps pace project development progress.

Students are encouraged to help each other complete in-class exercises.

Client-side technologies will be the primary focus during the first half of the semester, while server-side technologies will be in focus during the second half. A final exam will be administered on the date and time specified by the universityâ€™s [final exam schedule](http://www.southernct.edu/academics/Spring%202017%20TENTATIVE%20Final%20Exam%20Schedule%20Grid%201%2010%202017.pdf).
